# Partner B: Laieh - Frontend & Presentation (`CONTEXT_B.md` - Google Sign-in, Simple API, Frontend Cart)

**Your Goal:** Build the UI for Google Auth, Grocery List display, a simple Cart display, and implement the initial "Place Order" UI flow. Create Presenters to handle interactions and connect Views to the MobX model managed by Bhavya. Set up `App.jsx`.

**Core Modules:** `src/components/`, `src/presenters/`, `src/App.jsx`

**Context: Partner A (Bhavya)'s Parallel Work:**
*   Bhavya is setting up **Firebase** (Auth - Google Enabled, Firestore) & config.
*   Bhavya is implementing **`persistence.js`** (`onAuthStateChanged` reacting to your Google sign-in to update user/profile state in the model). He exports `auth`. **(Verified: User/profile data populates model)**.
*   Bhavya is defining **`QuicaModel.js`** (MobX store) with state: `user`, `userProfile`, `groceryItems`, `cart` (frontend cart), `isLoading`, `errorMessage`. He provides actions: `setUser`, `setUserProfile`, `loadGroceryItems`, `addToCart`, `clearUserData`. **(Verified: `addToCart` updates model state)**.
*   Bhavya is creating **`groceryAPI.js`** using the **Simple Grocery Store API (`GET /products`)** and *simulating prices*. The `loadGroceryItems` action uses this. **(Status: In Progress/Pending)**.

## Current Progress & Status (Updated)

### Completed Tasks:

**Phase 1: Foundational Setup - DONE**
- Created base UI components for Auth, Grocery List, Cart.

**Phase 2: Presenter Implementation & Core Logic - Mostly Done**
1. **Auth Integration - DONE**
   - Implemented `AuthPresenter.jsx` with Google Sign-in via `signInWithPopup`.
   - Integrated with Firebase `auth` object.
   - Verified basic login/logout flow updates MobX model (`myQuicaModel.user`).
2. **User Profile Persistence - Verified Working**
   - Confirmed that after login, `myQuicaModel.userProfile` is populated with data from Firestore via Bhavya's `persistence.js`.
3. **Frontend Cart Interaction - DONE**
   - Implemented `CartPresenter` reading `myQuicaModel.cart`.
   - Implemented "Add to Cart" button in `GroceryListPresenter` calling `myQuicaModel.addToCart`.
   - Verified cart UI updates correctly when items are added.
   - Verified cart clears on logout/login via `clearUserData`.
4. **App Structure & Integration - DONE**
   - Set up conditional rendering in `App.jsx` based on `myQuicaModel.user` (Auth vs Main App view).
   - Ensured relevant components (`App`, presenters) are wrapped with MobX `observer`.

### Current Status:

- Authentication flow (Google Sign-in) is functional and integrated with MobX state.
- User profile data is successfully persisted and loaded from Firestore into the model upon login.
- Frontend cart state management (add, display, clear) is working via MobX.
- Basic MVP structure (Model-Presenter-View separation) is in place.
- Logging helps trace state flow.

### Pending Items & Immediate Goals for Peer Review:

1.  **Integrate Grocery API Data:**
    *   **Action:** Replace mock grocery data with data fetched via `myQuicaModel.loadGroceryItems()` once Bhavya completes the `groceryAPI.js` implementation.
    *   **Priority:** High (Core requirement for review).
2.  **Implement "Place Order" UI Flow:**
    *   **Action:** Add a "Place Order" button (e.g., within `CartPresenter` or `CartView`).
    *   **Action:** Create a new simple view/component (e.g., `OrderPlacedView.jsx`) displaying:
        *   `<h1>Order placed successfully!</h1>`
        *   `<p>we're finding a rider who can deliver your groceries</p>`
    *   **Action:** Implement logic (likely in `App.jsx` or a parent component managing main views) to:
        *   Introduce a new state variable (e.g., `appViewMode` in React state, or maybe a simple flag in the MobX model like `orderJustPlaced = false`).
        *   When "Place Order" is clicked, update this state (`setAppViewMode('orderPlaced')` or `myQuicaModel.setOrderJustPlaced(true)`).
        *   Conditionally render the `OrderPlacedView` instead of the main Grocery/Cart view based on this new state.
        *   *(Optional for now)* Clicking "Place Order" could also call a `myQuicaModel.clearCart()` action.
    *   **Priority:** Medium-High (Demonstrates next step in user flow, adds interaction). **Backend order creation is NOT needed for this step.**
3.  **Testing & Debugging:**
    *   **Action:** Full end-to-end test: Sign in -> See API Groceries -> Add to Cart -> Place Order (UI change) -> Sign Out.
    *   **Priority:** High.

### Next Steps (Laieh):

1.  **Immediate Actions (Today/Vibe Session):**
    *   **Implement the "Place Order" UI flow (Step 2 above):** Add the button, the success view, and the state logic in `App.jsx` (or model) to switch between views.
    *   **Verify Profile Persistence Again:** Double-check the user profile loading is consistently working.
    *   **Coordinate with Bhavya:** Get ETA on API integration. If it arrives, integrate it immediately (Step 1 above).
2.  **Short-term Goals (Post-Session / Before Review):**
    *   Ensure the Grocery API data is integrated and displayed correctly.
    *   Refine the "Place Order" transition if needed.
    *   Perform thorough testing (Step 3 above).
    *   Coordinate deployment with Bhavya.
    *   Update README/Context files.

### Dependencies Update:

**From Bhavya (Status):**
- ✅ `firebaseConfig.js` - Received and integrated
- ✅ `QuicaModel.js` - Base implementation received, `addToCart` working.
- ✅ Firebase Auth - Configured and working
- ✅ User Profile Persistence - Verified working (loads data into model)
- ⏳ `groceryAPI.js` (**Simple Grocery API**) - **Pending**
- ⏳ `loadGroceryItems` implementation - **Pending**

### Key Learnings & Notes:

[Keep existing learnings...]
1. **State Management for Views:** Need a way to manage which main view is displayed (Auth vs. Grocery/Cart vs. OrderPlaced). Can use local React state in `App.jsx` or add a simple state flag to the MobX model.

### Next Meeting Agenda:

1. Demo current flow (Auth -> Profile Load -> Add to Cart).
2. Demo new "Place Order" UI transition.
3. Final check on Bhavya's API integration status.
4. Plan final testing & deployment for review.
5. Assign final README updates.
